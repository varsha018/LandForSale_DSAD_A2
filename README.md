DSAD Assignment 2

Problem Statement: A landlord owns a few acres of his property and rents/leases it out to 
someone else. Now he wants to invest in real estate as a source of financial profit. He decided 
to sell up to ‘x’ acres of his land in different regions for huge profit. There are ‘n’ different
regions with given acres of land he wants to sell in that area and along with its profit value, 
here your task would be to select the acres of land within ‘x’ limit, such that the total profit is 
maximized.
Note: you can select the complete acres of land available in that region or part of it according
to the ‘x’ limit as assumed. If there are multiple regions with the same profit value, first select 
the region with few acres of land and so on.
Requirements:
1. Maximize total profit within a limit of ‘x’ acres sold, selecting entire or part of 
region’s land
2. If multiple regions have the same profit per acre, prioritize the region with fewer 
acres.

as mentioned below:
